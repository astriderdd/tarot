/**
 * CARD TYPE DEFINITION
 * ====================
 * This file defines the TypeScript type for our tarot card data structure.
 * Think of it like a "blueprint" that describes what a tarot card object should look like.
 *
 * What is a TypeScript type?
 * A type is like a contract that says "every object of this type must have these exact properties
 * with these exact data types." It's like a recipe that tells TypeScript what to expect.
 *
 * Why do we need this?
 * - Catches errors before runtime (like typos in property names)
 * - Provides autocomplete and IntelliSense in your IDE
 * - Makes code more self-documenting and easier to understand
 * - Prevents bugs when refactoring or modifying code
 * - Helps other developers (including future you!) understand the data structure
 * - Makes the codebase more maintainable and professional
 *
 * In our tarot app, every card must have these 5 properties:
 * name, keywords, message, crystal, and crystal_suggestion

/**
 * Card - TypeScript type definition for a tarot card
 *
 * This type defines the structure of every tarot card object in our application.
 * Each property is required and must have the specified data type.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * const myCard: Card = {
 *   name: "The Fool",
 *   keywords: ["new beginnings", "adventure"],
 *   message: "Take the leap! This is your moment...",
 *   crystal: "citrine",
 *   crystal_suggestion: "Citrine brings joy and confidence..."
 * }
